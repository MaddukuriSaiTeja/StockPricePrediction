This project implements a hybrid MS-SSA-LSTM model for stock price prediction by integrating historical data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis from financial forums. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) enhances Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model adaptability, improving accuracy in volatile markets. The system efficiently processes real-time data and predicts trends with higher precision than traditional models. Ideal for algorithmic trading, financial forecasting, and market trend analysis.
