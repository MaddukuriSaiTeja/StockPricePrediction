1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Stock Tweets
 	- Signle Stock Data
	- All stock data(Multi Source data)
3. Data processing & Data Cleaning
	- For Tweets Sentiment
		- Cleaning the Tweets
			- Remove Punctuations
			- Remove HTML
			- Remove URL and emojis
		- Encoding & Tokeization the Tweets
			- Keras Tokenizer
	- For Stock Price
		- Pandas dataframe
		- Keras reshaping the data		
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Splitting the data to train and test
6. Building the model
	- For Tweets Sentiment
	    	- MLP
		- CNN
		- LSTM
		- MS-LSTM (Multi Source Data)
		- MS - SSA - LSTM (Multi Soucre - SSA optimizer)
		- Voting Classifier
		- LSTM + GRU
	- For Stock Price
		- MLP

7. training and building the model 

Flask Framework
=----------------

8. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
9. importing the packages
10. User gives input as Symbol of crytocurrencty
11. the given input is preprocessed and the data regarding cryto is scraped based yahoo finance 
12. with all this informtion, the define LSTM+GRU and Voting Regerssion model and ARIMA is used for prediction
14. final outcome is displayed through frontend



Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use different technique for analysis the dataset with Machine learning models, like MS-SSA-LSTM model for analysis the stock price and sentiment,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting  Classifier and LSTM + GRU for sentiment of stock and got 100% accuracy, where for stock price we used Voting Regression which got 99% R2 SCore,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
